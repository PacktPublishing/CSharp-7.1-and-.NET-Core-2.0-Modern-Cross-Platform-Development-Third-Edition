# C# 7.1 and .NET Core 2.0 – Modern Cross-Platform Development - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [C# 7.1 and .NET Core 2.0 – Modern Cross-Platform Development - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-71-and-net-core-20-–-modern-cross-platform-development-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788398077), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
C# 7.1 and .NET Core 2.0 – Modern Cross-Platform Development, Third Edition, is a practical guide to creating powerful cross-platform applications with C# 7.1 and .NET Core 2.0. It gives readers of any experience level a solid foundation in C# and .NET. The first part of the book runs you through the basics of C#, as well as debugging functions and object-oriented programming, before taking a quick tour through the latest features of C# 7.1 such as default literals, tuples, inferred tuple names, pattern matching, out variables, and more.

After quickly taking you through C# and how .NET works, this book dives into the .NET Standard 2.0 class libraries, covering topics such as packaging and deploying your own libraries, and using common libraries for working with collections, performance, monitoring, serialization, files, databases, and encryption. The final section of the book demonstrates the major types of application that you can build and deploy cross-device and cross-platform. In this section, you'll learn about websites, web applications, web services, Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, and mobile apps. By the end of the book, you'll be armed with all the knowledge you need to build modern, cross-platform applications using C# and .NET.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
 // storing items at index positions
    names[0] = "Kate";
    names[1] = "Jack";
    names[2] = "Rebecca";
    names[3] = "Tom";
```

You can develop and deploy C# on many platforms, including Windows, macOS, and many varieties of Linux. For the best programming experience, and to reach the most platforms, I recommend that you learn the basics of all members of the Visual Studio family: Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio for Mac.

My recommendation for the operating system and development tool combinations is as follows:

Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10
Visual Studio for Mac on macOS
Visual Studio Code on Windows 10 or macOS
The best version of Windows to use is Microsoft Windows 10 because you will need this version to create Universal Windows Platform apps in Chapter 17, Building Windows Apps Using XAML and Fluent Design. Earlier versions of Windows, such as 7 or 8.1, will work for the other chapters.

The best version of macOS to use is Sierra or High Sierra because you will need macOS to build iOS mobile apps in Chapter 18, Building Mobile Apps Using XAML and Xamarin.Forms. Although you can use Visual Studio 2017 on Windows to write the code for iOS and Android mobile apps, you must have macOS and Xcode to compile them.
